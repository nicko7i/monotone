# monotone

Monotone is a web service that issues monotonically increasing build numbers.

Given a changeset identifier, monotone provides strictly monotonically
ascending build numbers.  It also retains a record of previous build numbers,
the associated changeset identifier and source repository, and a timestamp.

Monotone works with any version control system having a unique string to
represent a change set.

Docker images are available on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/nicko7i/monotone/tags/).

# Usage

POSTing a hash or other changeset identifier to ``/changeset`` returns the newly allocated
build number in the response body.  If the changeset is already associated with
a build number, the previously allocated build number is returned.

```bash
build=$(curl -s -X POST http:my-server:8080/changeset/?hash=deadbeef)
echo ${build}
5
build=$(curl -s -X POST http:my-server:8080/changeset/?hash=deadbeef)
echo ${build}
5
```

A GET against that endpoint returns the most recent build number record:

```bash
curl -s -X GET http://my-server:8080/changeset
{"number":5,"hash":"deadbeef","date":"2018-09-08 22:27:29","repo":"backer"}
```

Providing the changeset ID returns the associated record:
```bash
curl -s -X GET http://my-server:8080/changeset?hash=bacon
{"number":3,"hash":"bacon","date":"2018-09-08 21:17:55","repo":"backer"}
```

Similarly, providing the build number returns the associated record: (implemented in v1.1)
```bash
curl -s -X GET http://my-server:8080/changeset?build=3
{"number":3,"hash":"bacon","date":"2018-09-08 21:17:55","repo":"backer"}
```

# Deploying

The following example runs the most recent "Version 1" release on port ``8080``.

The entire state of the service is contained in file ``/data/my-db.sqlite`` on the docker host.
``--restart unless-stopped`` ensures that the service will start and stop when docker itself
starts and stops, while ``systemctl enable docker`` ensures that docker itself
starts when the machine is booted. 

Note that the database file must exist before the service is started.

```bash
systemctl enable docker
docker pull nicko7i/monotone:1
mkdir -p /data
touch /data/my-db.sqlite
docker run -dit                               \
  -p 8080:3030                                \
  -e MONOTONE_SRC_REPO=my-project             \
  -v /data/my-db.sqlite:/data/monotone.sqlite \
  --restart unless-stopped                    \
  --name my-service-name                      \
  nicko7i/monotone:1
```

## Git Integration

Tagging the *git* commit makes the build number visible in GUI tools and ensures the
association is retained even if the service database is lost.
```$bash
build=$(curl -s -X POST http:my-server:8080/changeset/?hash=63b0a81cb26a31b08986c69bd050ade2315f2216)
git tag -a -m "build-${build}" "build-${build}" 63b0a81cb26a31b08986c69bd050ade2315f2216
```

## Increasing the Build Number

The build number can be made larger by editing the *sqlite* database file.
```bash
% sqlite3 /data/my-db.sqlite
sqlite> select * from sqlite_sequence;
builds|4
sqlite> update sqlite_sequence set seq = 1500 where name = 'builds';
sqlite> select * from sqlite_sequence;
builds|1500
sqlite>
```

Avoid making the build number smaller.  By design, the service does not overwrite existing
records.  The build number can be made smaller only if first all the records which have larger
build numbers are removed from the database.
